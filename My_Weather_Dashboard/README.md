# Weather-Dashboard

In this Challenge, I used jQuery, OpenWeatherMap Api, as well as Bootstrap to create a Dynamic Weather Dashboard which can be used to search and obtain the weather for the desired city.
It utilizes Local Storage and event listeners to save searched cities for later look-ups. The saved cities can also be removed and scrolled through as needed.

The deployed application can be found at: [abhibiju.github.io/Weather-Dashboard](https://abhibiju.github.io/Weather-Dashboard)

Here is what the website currently looks like:
